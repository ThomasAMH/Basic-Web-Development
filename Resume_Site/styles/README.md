The goal of this project is to prepare base funcationality, classes, functions, and structure for a desktop app called KKitchen that will serve as the app's desktop version, as well as foundation for the app's mobile and web versions.

The app function for the desktop version include the following:
Allowing a user to add ingredients to a file (saved in a folder under Data called Ingredients) (saved in .ing XML files) that serve as the basis for recipes.
Ingredients have a few base properties: name, price, and the number of dishes the ingreident is featured in, as well as a user note.

Recipes are combinations of ingredients and quanities in combination with a few extra properties.

These creating and accessing these recipes based on their attributes constitutes the major purpose and use case for the application.
